1. **Class Imbalance Problem**: The `Not You` class is dominating the `You` class. This makes it challenging for many algorithms to correctly predict the minority class. 

2. **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**:
   * You're using SMOTE to handle the imbalance, which is a good start. However, it's essential to ensure that you're using SMOTE correctly:
     * Apply SMOTE only on the training data and not on the validation or test set.
     * Ensure that the oversampling rate is appropriate. Sometimes, excessive oversampling can lead to overfitting.
   * The results after applying SMOTE, in most cases, seem worse. This might be due to overfitting or maybe the synthetic samples generated by SMOTE aren't representative enough.

3. **Algorithm Choice**:
   * Some algorithms are more sensitive to class imbalance than others. If you're using algorithms like logistic regression, consider using tree-based methods such as Random Forests or Gradient Boosting Machines, which can sometimes handle imbalances better.
   * Consider ensemble methods. They combine multiple models to improve overall performance.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   * Given the class imbalance, accuracy might not be the best metric for evaluating the model's performance. Consider focusing on F1-score, precision, and recall.
   * Additionally, look at the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC). It provides a comprehensive measure of performance across all possible classification thresholds.

5. **Alternative Resampling Techniques**:
   * Apart from SMOTE, there are other over-sampling and under-sampling techniques you could consider, like ADASYN, Borderline-SMOTE, and Random Under-sampling.

6. **Class Weights**:
   * Many algorithms allow you to set weights for different classes. By giving higher weights to the minority class (`You` in this case), you can potentially improve its recognition.

7. **Feature Engineering**:
   * Investigate if there are any other features or feature combinations you can extract from the data that might be predictive of the target variable.
   * Also, consider feature selection methods to get rid of unimportant features.

8. **Model Calibration**:
   * Adjust the decision threshold. By default, many algorithms use a threshold of 0.5 for binary classification. Adjusting this threshold can help in increasing the recall for the minority class at the cost of precision for the majority class.

9. **Domain Knowledge**:
   * If you have domain knowledge about the problem, use it to engineer features, clean the data, or even set specific rules.

10. **Data Collection**:
   * If feasible, consider collecting more data, especially for the minority class. More data often leads to better model performance.
