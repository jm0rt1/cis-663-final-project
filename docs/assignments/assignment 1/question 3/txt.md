Given this table of values, we have the angle theta which seems to be given in degrees. The singularity of a local area in a fingerprint is typically defined by the changes in the local orientation (theta) of the ridges. In particular, singularities are often categorised into two types:

1. **Whorl/Circular (Loop)**: This is where the local ridge orientation turns through a full 360 degrees. In terms of theta, you would see an increase or decrease of approximately 360 degrees as you traverse around the singularity.

2. **Bifurcation (Delta)**: This is where ridges meet and split, often forming a 'Y' shape. In terms of theta, you would see an increase or decrease of approximately 180 degrees as you traverse around the singularity.

Let's compute the changes in theta and categorize the singularities:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Defining the data
data = {'K': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],
        'theta': [80, 90, 260, 50, 110, 270, 130, 180]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

N = len(df)
pi = np.pi

# Compute sigma (theta_change)
df['sigma'] = df['theta'].shift(-1).fillna(df.iloc[0]['theta']) - df['theta']

# Compute delta
df['delta'] = df['sigma'].apply(lambda x: x if np.abs(x) < pi/2 else (x+pi if x <= -pi/2 else x-pi))

# Identify singularity type based on delta
df['singularity'] = df['delta'].apply(lambda x: 'Loop or Whorl' if np.abs(x) >= 2*pi else ('Delta' if np.abs(x) >= pi else 'None'))

print(df)

```

Please replace `350` and `370` for Loop and `170` and `190` for Delta with the exact range depending on how the fingerprint image is processed.

**NOTE:** This is a simplistic example and in practice the detection of singularities would consider the ridge orientation in a more localized way and possibly apply some form of smoothing or averaging. This is because the ridge orientation can be quite noisy, especially near the singularities. The theta provided here is assumed to be a smoothed/averaged version of the local ridge orientation. Also, it is crucial to ensure the angles are processed correctly in terms of their circular nature (i.e., an angle of 0 degrees is the same as an angle of 360 degrees). This script may require adjustment depending on how the theta was measured.
