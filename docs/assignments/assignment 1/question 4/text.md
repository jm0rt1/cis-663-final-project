# Question 4
Minutiae points, including bifurcation points and termination points, are features in fingerprint analysis. They are used in biometric systems for identifying individuals based on their unique fingerprint patterns. 

Here's how you can describe a 3x3 binary pixel grid for a bifurcation point and a non-minutiae point:

1. Bifurcation Point:

A bifurcation point in a fingerprint is a point where one ridge splits into two (or conversely two ridges merge into one). In a simplified 3x3 binary pixel grid, a bifurcation point might look like this:

```
0 1 0
1 1 1
0 1 0
```

Where '1' indicates the presence of a ridge, and '0' indicates the absence of a ridge. For this bifurcation point, the values of `b0,...,b7` (starting from the pixel in the top left and going clockwise around the center pixel) would be `b0=0, b1=1, b2=0, b3=1, b4=0, b5=1, b6=0, b7=1`.

The crossing number (CN), used to identify minutiae, is defined as half the sum of the absolute differences between pairs of consecutive pixels in the sequence `b0,...,b7`. For the bifurcation point, CN = 3.

2. Non-minutiae Point:

A non-minutiae point in a fingerprint is a point that is not a feature point, like a ridge that doesn't split or end. In a simplified 3x3 binary pixel grid, a non-minutiae point might look like this:

```
0 1 0
0 1 0
0 1 0
```

For this non-minutiae point, the values of `b0,...,b7` (starting from the pixel in the top left and going clockwise around the center pixel) would be `b0=0, b1=1, b2=0, b3=0, b4=0, b5=1, b6=0, b7=0`.

The crossing number for this non-minutiae point would be 0, as there are no changes from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0 in the sequence `b0,...,b7`.

Please note that these are very simplified examples for the purpose of explanation. Real fingerprints are much more complex and require sophisticated algorithms to analyze.
