# Milestone 1
Group Members: James Mortensen

## Introduction: 
CIS 663: Biometric Systems - Project Topic to be Determined

## Team roles and responsibilities:

This is a single member team, consisting of:

-  James Mortensen: Responsible for all aspects of the project, including project planning, topic selection, data gathering, model development, analysis, and presentation.

**Team Roles and responsibilities are to be determined in Milestone 3**

## Project goals and objectives: 

The goal of this project is to delve deep into a chosen area of biometric systems. Objectives will be further refined once the topic has been chosen, but they generally include:
1. Thorough literature review on the chosen biometric system.
2. Collection and preprocessing of relevant data for the system.
3. Development and training of machine learning models based on the system's requirements.
4. Evaluation of the system's performance.
5. Preparation of a detailed report and presentation of the project.

## Project scope:

The project will include data collection, model development, and evaluation, and the preparation of a detailed report and presentation. It will not include deployment or integration of the system into existing platforms or applications. The specific scope will be further refined once the project topic has been determined.

## Data sources: 

Publicly available datasets will be used for this project. The specific datasets will be determined based on the chosen project topic.

- Submitted all deliverables including the final report, presentation, and code.

## Potential challenges:

The project might face some challenges such as:
1. Difficulty in selecting an appropriate and interesting project topic.
2. Issues related to overfitting or underfitting during model training.
3. Limited performance due to the quality or diversity of the data used.
4. Time constraints for training complex models and fine-tuning their parameters.
5. Ensuring the relevance and applicability of the final system.
