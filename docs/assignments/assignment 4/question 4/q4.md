To determine the best algorithm and threshold, we first need to quantify the costs and benefits of each type of decision the system makes:

1. **True Positive (TP)**: A legitimate user is accepted.
   * Benefit: You charge $10.
   
2. **False Positive (FP)**: An imposter is wrongly accepted.
   * Cost: You charge $10, but then you have to refund it, so net is $0.
   * Note: The system could be defrauded multiple times by imposters if the FP rate is high.
   
3. **True Negative (TN)**: An imposter is correctly rejected.
   * Benefit: Fraud is avoided.
   
4. **False Negative (FN)**: A legitimate user is wrongly rejected.
   * Cost: Lost revenue of $100 because they'll use another parking garage.

Given the costs and benefits:

* Each TP is worth $10.
* Each FP costs nothing ($0) because you refund the amount, but it has security implications and could impact trust in your system.
* Each TN has no immediate financial value, but it maintains trust and security in your system.
* Each FN costs $100.

Given that 50% of requests are from imposters, you want to minimize both FP and FN, but FN has a much higher cost.

**Decision**:
You should choose an algorithm that has a very low false negative rate. This means you'd likely be willing to tolerate more false positives (and then deal with the refunds) in order to avoid the high cost of false negatives.

**Setting the threshold**:
Typically, an ROC curve is used to visualize the trade-offs between TP and FP rates for different thresholds. In this case:

* Lowering the threshold will increase both the TP and FP rates. This will make it more likely for legitimate users to gain access, but also more likely for imposters to get in. This may be acceptable since an imposter just results in a refund, but a legitimate user being rejected costs a lot more.

* Raising the threshold will decrease both the TP and FP rates. This makes it harder for both legitimate users and imposters to gain access.

Given the high cost of false negatives, you'd likely want to set a threshold that's relatively low. This will allow more users (and unfortunately, more imposters) in, but the financial cost of the occasional imposter is outweighed by the large cost of rejecting a legitimate user.

**Conclusion**:
Choose an algorithm that allows you to control the threshold and has a good balance of TP and FP in the desired range. Set the threshold such that the FN rate is minimized, even if it means a slightly higher FP rate. It might be useful to continuously monitor the rates and adjust as needed, especially if there are changes in user behavior or the imposter rate.
