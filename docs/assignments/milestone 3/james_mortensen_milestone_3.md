# Milestone 3: Duties Assigned and Contribution Statement for Facial Recognition Experiment

As the sole contributor to this project, the researcher is responsible for all aspects of the main paper that encompasses the conceptualization, development, and evaluation of a facial recognition experiment. The main duties for writing the paper can be divided as follows:

1. **Introduction:** The importance of facial recognition, its applications, and challenges are explained. The objective of the experiment, which could be evaluating the performance of a new facial recognition algorithm or comparing existing ones, is also discussed.

2. **Literature Review:** A thorough review of existing literature on facial recognition algorithms and techniques is conducted. Strengths and weaknesses of different approaches, standard performance metrics used, and how the project fits into this landscape are highlighted.

3. **Methodology:** The facial recognition algorithm implemented or the set of algorithms being compared are described. The datasets being used, how the data is preprocessed, and any augmentations applied are also discussed.
    
    **The following Data Set has already been chosen:**

    **Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) Dataset**: This dataset can be used for face verification tasks, where the goal is to determine whether two images depict the same person.

    The intent is to create a binary classification system where the system can recognize either you or not you.  The system will be trained on a set of images of you and a set of images of other people.  The system will then be tested on a set of images of you and a set of images of other people.  The system will be evaluated on its ability to correctly classify the images as you or not you.

4. **Implementation:** The practical steps of implementing the methodology are detailed. This involves setting up the facial detection and recognition pipeline, dealing with challenges related to image alignment, handling variations in pose, light, etc.

    Some code has already been written to help with this.  The code is located in the following repository:

5. **Results and Discussion:** The results obtained from the experiment are presented. These could be in the form of accuracy, precision, recall, or other metrics relevant to facial recognition. These results are then discussed, drawing comparisons with the performance reported in existing literature if applicable.

6. **Conclusion and Future Work:** The findings are summarized and their implications on the field of facial recognition are discussed. Any potential improvements that could be made to the experiment or the algorithm used, based on the results obtained, are suggested.

7. **Proofreading and Finalizing:** The paper is proofread for any grammatical errors or inaccuracies in content. It is ensured that the paper is well-structured, logical, and follows any guidelines given for submission.

The researcher's personal contributions to this facial recognition project span every aspect of its conception, execution, and evaluation. The research question was identified, literature review conducted, experiment designed and implemented, and results evaluated, and the paper presenting the work will be written by the researcher.
