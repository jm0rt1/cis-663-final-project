### Introduction

#### Background

##### Historical Context
Facial recognition, the computational and technological process of identifying or verifying an individual's identity using their face, has its roots in the mid-20th century, with the advent of computer science. Initially focusing on simple geometric measurements and patterns, the field has since advanced to utilize sophisticated machine learning and deep learning algorithms.

##### Modern Applications
In today's rapidly advancing technological landscape, facial recognition has found extensive applications across various domains:
- **Security and Law Enforcement**: It aids authorities in criminal investigations, airport security checks, and border control.
- **User Authentication**: It provides a secure way for users to unlock devices or access restricted areas.
- **Personalized Marketing**: Businesses use this technology to offer customized experiences to customers by recognizing their preferences.
- **Healthcare**: Medical professionals are exploring facial recognition for patient identification and even potential diagnostic applications.

##### Evolution of Techniques
The growth of facial recognition has been heavily influenced by two key factors:
1. **Data Availability**: The proliferation of large, publicly available datasets has enabled researchers to train more complex models.
2. **Algorithm Advancements**: The shift from traditional image processing techniques to deep learning has revolutionized the field. Neural networks have been instrumental in automating feature extraction, contributing to the significant improvement in accuracy and efficiency [[Source 3]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/381842).

#### Objective and Scope

##### Research Objectives
The main goal of this research is to design, implement, and evaluate a cutting-edge facial recognition system. The focus will be on integrating both traditional methods and advanced deep learning techniques to achieve a comprehensive understanding of facial features.

##### Specific Aims
1. **System Design**: To conceptualize a robust system that combines various algorithms for feature extraction and recognition.
2. **Algorithm Selection**: To explore different methodologies, including Eigenfaces, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and select the most suitable combination.
3. **Data Handling**: To gather, prepare, and augment a diverse dataset that represents various human faces with different expressions, angles, lighting conditions, and ethnic backgrounds.
4. **Training and Evaluation**: To implement an effective training strategy and conduct a thorough performance evaluation, encompassing aspects like accuracy, scalability, and real-time responsiveness.
5. **Ethical Considerations**: To address the ethical implications of facial recognition, including privacy concerns and potential biases.

##### Scope
The research will concentrate on creating a system that excels in face verification, where the objective is to confirm or deny the identity claim of an individual. This focus aligns with the vision articulated by Taigman et al. in DeepFace, striving to bridge the gap between machine and human-level performance in this particular task [[Source 1]](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2014/papers/Taigman_DeepFace_Closing_the_2014_CVPR_paper.pdf).

#### Conclusion of Introduction
The burgeoning field of facial recognition offers immense potential and also poses unique challenges. This research aims to contribute meaningfully to the field by marrying traditional methods with modern deep learning techniques. In doing so, it hopes to provide insights into creating a system that is not only technically advanced but also cognizant of the broader societal and ethical implications. By thoroughly understanding the past work and meticulously designing the experiment, the research sets the stage for a promising exploration into the frontiers of facial recognition technology.
