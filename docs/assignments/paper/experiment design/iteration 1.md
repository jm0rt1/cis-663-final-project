### Experiment Design

#### Overview
The facial recognition system is designed with a primary focus on employing advanced deep learning techniques. The entire process is divided into several stages, each of which is described in detail below.

#### Face Detection Module
The first stage of the facial recognition system is to detect the faces in a given image. This crucial step involves using Haar cascades, which are a well-known object detection method employed to recognize faces by identifying specific features and patterns.

##### Algorithm
The face detection relies on the OpenCV library, which provides pre-trained Haar cascades. The selected cascade file, `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`, was fine-tuned to detect frontal faces with a high degree of accuracy [[Source 3]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/381842).

##### Preprocessing
Before applying the Haar cascades, the images underwent preprocessing to enhance detection accuracy. This involved resizing, color conversion, and filtering to eliminate noise.

#### Face Recognition Module
The second stage of the system is the recognition module, combining dimensionality reduction and a classifier. A two-step approach is employed here: using the Eigenfaces method to reduce the dimensions and subsequently applying an SVM for classification.

##### Eigenfaces and Dimensionality Reduction
The Eigenfaces method builds a lower-dimensional space by selecting the principal components from the original high-dimensional data. This is done using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), as described by Turk and Pentland [[Source 4]](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/jocn.1991.3.1.71).

##### Support Vector Machine (SVM)
An SVM was used as the classifier. By creating a hyperplane, SVM distinguishes different classes, providing robust classification especially when dealing with high-dimensional data [[Source 5]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6229.pdf).

##### Training
A dataset consisting of 50 face samples, each with 100 features, was generated. The dataset was split into training and testing sets, allowing for an unbiased evaluation of the recognition performance.

#### Experiment Procedure
The experimental procedure is a well-orchestrated sequence of steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Faces were gathered from a varied dataset including different expressions, lighting conditions, and orientations to test the system under real-world conditions.
2. **Face Detection**: Haar cascades were employed to detect faces, as detailed above.
3. **Preprocessing**: A further alignment and normalization step was applied to the detected faces to ensure consistency and to prepare the data for feature extraction.
4. **Feature Extraction**: A custom deep learning model was used to extract relevant features from the face data. This stage was heavily influenced by advances in convolutional networks and image recognition techniques [[Source 8]](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf), [[Source 9]](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/papers/Szegedy_Going_Deeper_With_2015_CVPR_paper.pdf).
5. **Training the Recognizer**: The recognizer was trained on the extracted features using the Eigenfaces method and SVM, as described above.
6. **Evaluation**: The system was assessed on a separate test set, focusing on accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Additional metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score were also considered to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the system's performance.

#### Conclusion of Design
The design of the facial recognition system is comprehensive, involving a layered approach that ensures precision at each step. The combination of traditional techniques like Haar cascades with advanced deep learning methods sets the stage for a sophisticated and potentially high-performing system. By drawing on the strengths of the chosen methodologies and carefully constructing the experimental procedure, this design lays the foundation for a rigorous exploration of facial recognition using advanced deep learning techniques.
