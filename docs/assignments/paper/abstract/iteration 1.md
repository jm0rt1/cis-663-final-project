### Abstract

Facial recognition systems have gained considerable traction in various applications, including security, authentication, and human-computer interaction. This paper meticulously outlines the design and implementation of a facial recognition system that seamlessly integrates face detection and recognition. The system employs Haar cascades for precise face detection, followed by Eigenfaces for dimensionality reduction and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for robust classification. Extensive preprocessing techniques ensure quality inputs, and a comprehensive evaluation strategy guarantees reliable performance. The design's strength lies in its flexibility, scalability, and attention to detail, promising a significant contribution to the evolving field of facial recognition.
