# Daily Notes

## Goals for Today 2023-07-11 â€” Present

- [ ] [[Research on the current state-of-the-art facial recognition algorithms]]
- [ ] [[Collect a dataset for training the facial recognition model]]
- [ ] [[Start the process of training the machine learning model]]

## Meetings/Events

- Team meeting to discuss project progress and next steps.
- Meeting with professor for guidance and clarifications.

## New Ideas

- Idea to incorporate a certain preprocessing technique to improve the model's performance.
- Idea to use a specific convolutional neural network architecture for the model.

## Progress on Goals

- Found several recent papers on advanced facial recognition algorithms.
- Found a suitable open-source dataset for training the model.
- Set up the machine learning environment and started the initial model training.

Today we decided to use Convolutional Neural Networks for our facial recognition model. More details about this technique can be found [[Facial Recognition Algorithms Review#^6a562a|here]]

## What I Learned Today

- Learned about a new technique for image preprocessing that can improve facial recognition.
- Learned how to set up a machine learning training environment.

## End of Day Reflection

- Satisfied with the progress made today, especially with finding a suitable dataset.
- Need to spend more time understanding the advanced facial recognition algorithms from the recent papers.
