## Citation

- Yang, H., Jia, X., Loy, C. C., & Robinson, P. (2015). An empirical study of recent face alignment methods. arXiv preprint arXiv:1511.05049.

## Key Points

- The authors provide a comprehensive evaluation of several state-of-the-art face alignment methods on the 300W dataset, using different evaluation metrics, face detectors, and experimental settings.
- The authors propose a new evaluation metric, area under error distribution curve within a threshold (AUC), to measure the performance of face alignment methods more robustly and fairly.
- The authors conduct face alignment sensitivity analysis with respect to face detection, on both synthetic and real data, using both off-the-shelf and re-trained models.
- The authors identify factors that are important for achieving good performance and robustness in face alignment, such as data augmentation, model size, initialization, and tracking smoothness.

## Relevance to Our Project

- This source is important for our project because it provides a systematic and rigorous comparison of different face alignment methods, which can help us choose the best method for our application.
- This source also provides insights into the challenges and limitations of current face alignment methods, and suggests possible directions for future improvement.

## Quotes

- "Face alignment is often served as an intermediate step in commonly used face analysis pipeline (face detection )face alignment )face recognition)." (p. 1)
- "Despite the fact that most current face alignment methods [52], [49], [48], [5], [28], [40] build on top of face detection, few of them have discussed the face alignment sensitivity w.r.t face detection variation." (p. 1)
- "We propose a new evaluation metric for face alignment on a set of images, i.e., area under error distribution curve within a threshold (AUC), given the fact that the traditional evaluation measure (mean error) is very sensitive to big alignment error." (p. 2)
- "We extend the 300W database with more practical face detections to make fair comparison possible." (p. 2)
- "We carry out face alignment sensitivity analysis w.r.t. face detection, on both synthetic and real data, using both off-the-shelf and re-trained models." (p. 2)
- "We study factors that are particularly important to achieve good performance and provide suggestions for practical applications." (p. 2)
