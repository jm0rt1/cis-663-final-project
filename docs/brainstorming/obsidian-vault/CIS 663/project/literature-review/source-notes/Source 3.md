R. Chellappa, C. L. Wilson and S. Sirohey, "Human and machine recognition of faces: a survey," inÂ _Proceedings of the IEEE_, vol. 83, no. 5, pp. 705-741, May 1995, doi: 10.1109/5.381842.

## Key Points

- The source provides a comprehensive survey of the literature on human and machine recognition of faces, covering various aspects such as psychological studies, face representation, feature extraction, matching techniques, and applications.
- The source also identifies some of the challenges and open problems in face recognition research, such as pose variation, illumination changes, expression variation, occlusion, aging, and spoofing.
- The source evaluates the performance of some existing face recognition systems and compares them with human performance.

## Relevance to Our Project

- This source is relevant for our project because it gives us a broad overview of the state-of-the-art in face recognition research as of 1995. It helps us understand the historical development of the field and the key issues that need to be addressed.
- This source also provides us with some useful references to other related works that we can explore further.

## Quotes

- "Face recognition is a fascinating problem both for human beings and machines." (p. 705)
- "The human ability to recognize faces is remarkable. We can recognize thousands of faces learned throughout our lifetime and identify familiar faces at a glance even after years of separation." (p. 706)
- "Despite the apparent ease with which humans recognize faces, building an automated system for face recognition is quite difficult." (p. 706)
- "There are two main approaches to face recognition: holistic and analytic." (p. 709)
- "The performance of face recognition systems depends on several factors such as the quality and resolution of the input images, the size and pose of the face, the illumination conditions, the presence or absence of occlusion, noise, or disguise, and the degree of similarity or dissimilarity among different faces." (p. 736)
