- Y. Sun, Y. Chen, X. Wang and X. Tang, “Deep learning face representation by joint identification-verification,” 2014 28th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, Montreal, QC, Canada, 2014, pp. 1988-1996.

## Key Points

- The paper proposes a deep learning approach for face representation that uses both identification and verification signals as supervision.
- The paper introduces a novel network architecture that consists of two sub-networks: one for identification and one for verification. The two sub-networks share the same convolutional layers but have different fully connected layers.
- The paper also proposes a triplet loss function that minimizes the distance between faces of the same identity and maximizes the distance between faces of different identities. The triplet loss function is applied to the verification sub-network.
- The paper evaluates the proposed method on the LFW dataset and achieves state-of-the-art results with 99.15% accuracy.

## Relevance to Our Project

- This source is relevant for our project because it shows how deep learning can be used to learn effective face representations that are invariant to age, pose, expression, and illumination.
- This source also provides insights into how to design network architectures and loss functions that can leverage both identification and verification signals for face recognition.
- This source also demonstrates how to use large-scale face datasets to train deep networks and improve their generalization ability.

## Quotes

- "We argue that DeepID can be effectively learned through challenging multi-class face identification tasks, whilst they can be generalized to other tasks (such as verification) and new identities unseen in the training set." (p. 1988)
- "The key challenge of face recognition is to develop effective feature representations for reducing intra-personal variations while enlarging inter-personal differences." (p. 1988)
- "The face identification task increases the inter-personal variations by drawing DeepID2 extracted from different identities apart, while the face verification task reduces the intra-personal variations by pulling DeepID2 extracted from the same identity together, both of which are essential to face recognition." (p. 1989)
- "The triplet loss function is designed to optimize the embedding itself rather than an intermediate bottleneck layer as in previous deep learning approaches." (p. 1990)
