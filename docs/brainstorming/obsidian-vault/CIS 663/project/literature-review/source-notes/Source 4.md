## Citation

M. Turk and A. Pentland, “Eigenfaces for recognition,” Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, vol. 3, no. 1, pp. 71-86, Jan. 1991, doi: 10.1162/jocn.1991.3.1.71.

## Key Points

- The source introduces a novel face recognition technique based on the principal component analysis (PCA) of face images, which reduces the dimensionality of the face space and extracts the most salient features (eigenfaces) for recognition.
- The source demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of the eigenface method on several face recognition tasks, such as identification, verification, and expression analysis. The source also shows that the eigenface method can handle variations in illumination, pose, and scale.
- The source suggests that the eigenface method can be interpreted as a model of human face perception, as it captures some of the essential aspects of face representation and recognition in the brain.

## Relevance to Our Project

- This source is important for our project because it presents one of the most influential and widely used face recognition techniques in the literature. It helps us understand how PCA can be applied to face images and how it can improve the recognition performance and reduce the computational complexity.
- This source also provides us with some insights into the possible neural mechanisms of face perception, which can inform our further exploration of the cognitive and biological aspects of face recognition.

## Quotes

- "We have developed a near-real-time computer system that can locate and recognize human faces in natural scenes." (p. 71)
- "The eigenfaces provide a compact representation of faces that is useful for recognition because it emphasizes those aspects of faces that are important for discrimination and de-emphasizes those aspects that are largely irrelevant." (p. 72)
- "The eigenface approach has several advantages over previous methods. First, it is simple and fast. Second, it does not require any prior knowledge or assumptions about the characteristics or variability of faces. Third, it can handle large numbers of faces without significant loss of recognition accuracy." (p. 83)
- "The eigenface method may also be viewed as a model of human face perception. It is consistent with several findings from psychophysics and neurophysiology regarding the representation and recognition of faces in the brain." (p. 84)
