Y. LeCun, L. Bottou, Y. Bengio and P. Haffner, “Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition,” in Proceedings of the IEEE, vol. 86, no. 11, pp. 2278-2324, Nov. 1998.

## Key Points

- The source provides a comprehensive overview of the gradient-based learning methods applied to document recognition, such as optical character recognition (OCR), handwritten digit recognition, and text categorization.
- The source focuses on the convolutional neural network (CNN) technique, which is a special type of neural network that can exploit the local structure and invariance properties of natural images. The source describes the architecture, training, and applications of CNNs in detail.
- The source also discusses some of the challenges and future directions of document recognition research, such as dealing with complex layouts, noisy inputs, multilingual documents, and semantic analysis.

## Relevance to Our Project

- This source is relevant for our project because it gives us a thorough introduction to the CNN technique, which is one of the most powerful and widely used techniques in computer vision and pattern recognition. It helps us understand the principles and advantages of CNNs and how they can be applied to various document recognition tasks.
- This source also provides us with some useful references to other related works and datasets that we can explore further.
