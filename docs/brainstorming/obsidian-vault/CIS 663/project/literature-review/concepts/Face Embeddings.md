Face embeddings are learned representations of face images, typically produced by a neural network. These embeddings are usually vectors in a high-dimensional space, and they have the property that distances between embeddings correspond to face similarity.

Key Points:
- Face embeddings are generated from deep learning models, typically convolutional neural networks.
- Face embeddings capture the significant features of faces and are used for face verification, recognition, and clustering tasks.
- The quality of a face embedding is often evaluated based on how well it can differentiate between different identities and generalize to unseen faces.
