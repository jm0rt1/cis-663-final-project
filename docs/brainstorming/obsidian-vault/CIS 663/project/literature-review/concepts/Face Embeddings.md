Face embeddings are learned representations of face images, typically produced by a neural network. These embeddings are usually vectors in a high-dimensional space, and they have the property that distances between embeddings correspond to face similarity.

Key Points:
- Face embeddings are generated from deep learning models, typically convolutional neural networks.
- Face embeddings capture the significant features of faces and are used for face verification, recognition, and clustering tasks.
- The quality of a face embedding is often evaluated based on how well it can differentiate between different identities and generalize to unseen faces.

In bmvc (Vol. 1, No. 3, p. 6).]] This paper presents a deep learning model for face recognition that generates embeddings of faces. The model is trained to recognize identities, and the embeddings it produces capture identity information.

These embeddings are used for face verification tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of face embeddings for this purpose.
