# Image Recognition

- Image recognition is the task of identifying and classifying objects, scenes, faces, or other entities in an image.
- Image recognition is a subfield of computer vision and has many applications in fields such as biometrics, security, surveillance, medical imaging, robotics, and entertainment.
- Image recognition is often performed using deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), that can learn high-level features from large amounts of labeled or unlabeled data.
- Image recognition is also influenced by factors such as image quality, resolution, illumination, occlusion, pose, and background.
- Image recognition is still an active area of research and faces challenges such as scalability, robustness, generalization, and interpretability.
