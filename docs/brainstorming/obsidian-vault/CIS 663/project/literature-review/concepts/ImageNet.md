# ImageNet

- ImageNet is a large visual database designed for use in visual object recognition software research.
- ImageNet contains more than 14 million images that have been hand-annotated by the project to indicate what objects are pictured and in at least one million of the images, bounding boxes are also provided.
- ImageNet is organized according to the WordNet hierarchy, which is a lexical database that groups words into sets of synonyms and defines their semantic relations.
- ImageNet has been instrumental in advancing computer vision and deep learning research, especially since the launch of the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) in 2010, where software programs compete to correctly classify and detect objects and scenes in the dataset.
- ImageNet has inspired many deep learning models and architectures, such as AlexNet, GoogleNet, and DeepFace, that have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various image recognition tasks.
