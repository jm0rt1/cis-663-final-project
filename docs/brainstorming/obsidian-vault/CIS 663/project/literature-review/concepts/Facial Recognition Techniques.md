Facial recognition techniques are methods used to identify or verify a person's identity using their face. These techniques can be based on traditional image processing methods or modern machine learning methods.

Key Points:
- Traditional techniques often involve extracting features from face images, such as edges or texture, and using these features to identify faces.
- Modern techniques often involve training a deep learning model, such as a [[Convolutional Neural Networks|Convolutional Neural Network]] (CNN), to learn a representation of face images.
- Some notable modern techniques include the DeepFace and FaceNet models, which have achieved near-human performance on face recognition tasks.
