Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of artificial neural network designed to process data with a grid-like topology, such as an image, which has the topology of a 2D grid of pixels.

Key Points:
- CNNs are composed of one or more convolutional layers, often followed by pooling layers, and then fully connected layers towards the end of the network.
- They are particularly effective for image recognition tasks because they can automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features.
- CNNs have been successfully applied to face recognition tasks, with models like DeepFace using a 9-layer CNN architecture.
