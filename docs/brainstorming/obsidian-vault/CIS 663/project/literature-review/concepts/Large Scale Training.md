# Large Scale Training
In machine learning and particularly deep learning, large scale training refers to training models on large datasets often comprising millions of examples.

Key Points:
- Large scale training allows models to learn more generalized and robust features, improving their ability to perform on unseen data.
- It often requires significant computational resources and optimized algorithms to handle the vast quantity of data.
- Deep learning models for face recognition, like DeepFace and FaceNet, are often trained on large scale datasets to ensure their efficacy and robustness.
