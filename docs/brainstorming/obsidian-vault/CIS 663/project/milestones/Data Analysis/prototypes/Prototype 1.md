# Prototype 1:

Concept: Develop an object oriented framework in Python that utilizes the LFW to recognize my face

```python
import numpy as np
import cv2
from sklearn import svm
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

class FaceRecognizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier('haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')
        self.recognizer = svm.SVC(gamma='scale')

    def prepare_data(self, data):
        faces = []
        labels = []
        for image, label in data:
            gray_image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
            faces_rect = self.face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray_image, scaleFactor=1.2, minNeighbors=5)
            for (x, y, w, h) in faces_rect:
                faces.append(gray_image[y:y+w, x:x+h])
                labels.append(label)
        return faces, labels

    def train(self, faces, labels):
        self.recognizer.fit(faces, labels)

    def predict(self, image):
        gray_image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
        faces_rect = self.face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray_image, scaleFactor=1.2, minNeighbors=5)
        for (x, y, w, h) in faces_rect:
            return self.recognizer.predict([gray_image[y:y+w, x:x+h]])[0]
        return None

# Using the framework:
# face_recognizer = FaceRecognizer()
# faces, labels = face_recognizer.prepare_data(your_data) # `your_data` should be a list of (image, label) tuples
# face_recognizer.train(faces, labels)
# print(face_recognizer.predict(your_image)) # `your_image` should be an OpenCV image
```



First, we need to install necessary libraries. You can use pip to install them:

```bash
pip install opencv-python scikit-learn
```

Then, run the following script to capture some face images:

```python
import cv2

# Create a new VideoCapture object
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

# Initialize the face recognizer
face_recognizer = FaceRecognizer()

# Initialize some variables
count = 0
label = 0
data = []

# Loop over frames from the video file stream
while count < 20:
    # Grab the frame from the video stream
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    
    # If the frame was not grabbed, then we have reached the end of the stream
    if not ret:
        break

    # Detect faces in the frame and append them to our data list
    faces, labels = face_recognizer.prepare_data([(frame, label)])
    if faces:
        data.append((faces[0], label))
        count += 1

    # If we have collected 10 faces, change the label
    if count == 10:
        label = 1

    # Display the resulting frame
    cv2.imshow('Frame', frame)

    # If the 'q' key is pressed, stop the loop
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

# Release the VideoCapture object
cap.release()

# Close all OpenCV windows
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

This script captures 20 face images from your webcam, labeling the first 10 images as '0' and the next 10 images as '1'. The images are stored in the `data` list.

The idea is to collect 10 images of one face (let's say your face) which are labeled as '0', and then 10 images of other faces (could be different people or just one different person) labeled as '1'. This creates a binary classification problem for the model to learn from - recognizing whether a given face image is 'you' (label 0) or 'not you' (label 1).

Next, you can use this data to train and test your model:

```python
# Split the data into a training set and a test set
train_data, test_data = train_test_split(data, test_size=0.5)

# Train the face recognizer on the training data
faces, labels = zip(*train_data)
face_recognizer.train(faces, labels)

# Test the face recognizer on the test data
correct = 0
for face, label in test_data:
    if face_recognizer.predict(face) == label:
        correct += 1

print(f'Accuracy: {correct / len(test_data) * 100}%')
```

This script splits the data into a training set and a test set, trains the face recognizer on the training data, and then tests it on the test data, printing the accuracy of the model.

Please remember, this is a very basic face recognition system and may not work well with varying lighting conditions, orientations, etc. For more accurate face recognition, consider using a more advanced method, such as a deep learning-based approach.

Also, please note that the cascade file `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` must be in your working directory. You can download it from the OpenCV repository on GitHub [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/data/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml).

And as always, consider privacy and consent concerns when working with facial recognition systems.
