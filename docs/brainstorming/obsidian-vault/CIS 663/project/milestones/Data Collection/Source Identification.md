## Introduction

This document introduces potential sources that could be analyzed for use in this project

## Potential Sources

Publicly available datasets will be used for this project. The specific datasets will be determined based on the chosen project topic.

1. [[project/milestones/Data Collection/Data Source 1|**Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) Dataset**:]] This dataset can be used for face verification tasks, where the goal is to determine whether two images depict the same person.

2. [[project/milestones/Data Collection/Data Source 2|**YouTube Faces Database (YTF)**]]: This dataset, which contains videos instead of static images, may allow this project to test the system's performance under more realistic and challenging conditions.

3. [[project/milestones/Data Collection/Data Source 3|**CelebFaces Attributes (CelebA) Dataset**]]: This large-scale dataset might be used for both training our system to recognize various celebrities and testing its generalization ability across different attributes and variations.

4. [[project/milestones/Data Collection/Data Source 4|**CASIA-WebFace**:]] This dataset can provide us with a vast amount of data for training, allowing our system to learn from a large number of subjects.

5. [[project/milestones/Data Collection/Data Source 5|**Face Recognition Grand Challenge (FRGC)**]]: The project could use use this dataset to benchmark our system and compare its performance with other state-of-the-art systems.

6. [[project/milestones/Data Collection/Data Source 6|**MS-Celeb-1M**:]] A high-volume dataset that could be used to train our model to recognize a wide array of celebrities.
