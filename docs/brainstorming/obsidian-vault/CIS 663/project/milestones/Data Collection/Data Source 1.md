# Data Source 1: Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) Dataset


## Description

The Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset is a public benchmark for face verification, also known as pair matching. The dataset contains more than 13,000 images of faces collected from the internet. The images are labeled with the name of the person the image depicts.

The dataset is structured to provide varying conditions, including different illuminations, expressions, and other variations which make the task of verifying whether two images represent the same person a challenge. It has been widely used in the research community for testing the effectiveness of face verification algorithms.
